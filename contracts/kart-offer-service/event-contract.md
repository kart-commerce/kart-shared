# Event Contract: kart-offer-service

Exchange: `offer.exchange` (owned by this service, per [kart-conventions.md](../../standards/kart-conventions.md)). Every consumer queue below gets its own DLQ per the reusable event standard — never shared.

| Event | Routing Key | Published/Consumed | Key Fields | Retry | DLQ | Criticality Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CouponRedeemed` | `offer.coupon.redeemed` | Published (Order, Analytics) | `code`, `orderId` | 2x | `offer.coupon-redeemed.dlq` | See below — resolved, not `Payment*` tier |
| `CouponRedemptionVoided` | `offer.coupon.redemption-voided` | Published (Analytics) | `code`, `orderId`, `voidedAt` | 2x | `offer.coupon-redemption-voided.dlq` | Same justification as `CouponRedeemed` — symmetric event, symmetric tier |
| `CouponIssued` | `offer.coupon.issued` | Published (Analytics) | `code`, `perUserCap`, `globalCap`, `validFrom`, `validUntil` | 2x | `offer.coupon-issued.dlq` | New (ddd-model.md), fired on `POST /coupons`. Same tier as its sibling Coupon events — admin-write-path visibility for Analytics, no money-moving/oversell risk |
| `CouponDeactivated` | `offer.coupon.deactivated` | Published (Analytics) | `code`, `deactivatedAt` | 2x | `offer.coupon-deactivated.dlq` | New (ddd-model.md), fired only on explicit `POST /coupons/{couponCode}/deactivate` — never on natural `validityWindow` expiry. Same tier as its sibling Coupon events |
| `PriceQuoteIssued` | `offer.pricing.quote-issued` | Published (Analytics) | `quoteId`, `total`, `expiresAt` | 2x | `offer.quote-issued.dlq` | Standard tier, matching BRD §10's assigned tier (2x) per ADR-0008 — own DLQ per the reusable event standard's "never shared" rule (event-standards.md), rather than BRD §10's simplified shared `coupon.dlq` label |
| `PromotionActivated` | `offer.promotion.activated` | Published (Analytics) | `campaignId`, `window` | 2x | `offer.promotion-activated.dlq` | Standard tier, matching BRD §10's assigned tier (2x) per ADR-0008 — own DLQ per the reusable event standard |
| `PromotionDeactivated` | `offer.promotion.deactivated` | Published (Analytics) | `campaignId` | 2x | `offer.promotion-deactivated.dlq` | Not in BRD §10 (new event, symmetric counterpart to `PromotionActivated`) — same tier as its sibling, same Analytics-only consumer resolution |
| `ProductPriceChanged` | `product.price.changed` | Consumed (from Product) | `sku`, `oldPrice`, `newPrice` | — (consumer side) | — | N/A — Product owns retry/DLQ for its own publication |
| `OrderCancelled` | `order.order.cancelled` | Consumed (from Order) | `orderId`, `reason` | — (consumer side) | — | N/A — Order owns retry/DLQ for its own publication |

## Requirement-Spec Q2 Resolution: Coupon Retry Tier

**Resolved: keep the BRD's 2x/no-paging tier for `CouponRedeemed`, `CouponRedemptionVoided`, `CouponIssued`, and `CouponDeactivated` — do not promote to the `Payment*` 5x/paged tier.**

Rationale: the double-charge risk the `Payment*` tier exists to guard against is owned and enforced by Order/Payment's own idempotency keys and Saga compensation (BRD §12) — Order creates one order regardless of whether a `CouponRedeemed` event is delayed or lost. A lost/retried `CouponRedeemed` event's worst case is a temporarily inaccurate Analytics count or a delayed Order-side record of which coupon applied, not a financial double-charge or an oversell. That's the same risk class as `ReviewSubmitted`, which the BRD already puts at 2x. Promoting Coupon events to the money-moving tier would page on-call for a class of failure that isn't actually money-critical — the BRD's original classification was correct, not an oversight.
